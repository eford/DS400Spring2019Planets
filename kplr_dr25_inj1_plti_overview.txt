# Which collumns to use for what

Identifiers (useful for crossmatching, but not as a feature in learning process):
\ KIC_ID
\     The KIC ID of the target star
\ TCE_ID
\     The Threshold Crossing Event (TCE) identifier, consisting of the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) ID, followed by a dash, and then the planet number

We expect that most important input feature will be:
\ Expected_MES
\     The expected multiple event statistic (MES) of the injected signal
Other columns from this file that students could choose to use as features:
\ Sky_Group
\     The sky group of the target star 
\ i_period
\     The orbital period (days) of the injected signal
\ i_epoch
\     The epoch (BJD-2454833) of the injected signal
\ N_Transit
\     The number of valid transits contributing to the expected MES signal
\ i_depth
\     The central transit depth (ppm) of the injected signal, measured after aperture corrections have been applied
\ i_dur
\     The transit duration (hours) of the injected signal
\ i_b
\     The impact parameter of the injected signal
\ i_ror
\     The ratio of the planet radius to the stellar radius for the injected signal
\ i_dor
\     The ratio of the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit to the stellar radius for the injected signal

Goal is to accurately predict the output field:
\ Recovered
\     A flag indicating successful (1) or unsuccessful (0) recovery of the injected signal by the search pipeline

Students should NOT use the following as features for the first project (since they can't be know before running the pipeline):  
\ EB_injection
\     A flag indicating whether a simulated eclipsing binary signal was injected on the target star 
\ Offset_from_source
\     A flag indicating whether the transit signal was injected on the target star or offset from the target star
\ Offset_distance
\     For targets injected off the target source, the distance from the target source location to the location of the injected signal (in arcseconds)
\ Measured_MES
\     The maximum multiple event statistic (MES) measured by the pipeline on the recovered signal
\ r_period
\     The orbital period (days) of the recovered signal
\ r_epoch
\     The epoch (BJD-2454833) of the recovered signal
\ r_depth
\     The central transit depth (ppm) of the recovered signal
\ r_dur
\     The transit duration (hours) of the recovered signal
\ r_b
\     The impact parameter of the recovered signal
\ r_ror
\     The ratio of the planet radius to the stellar radius for the recovered signal
\ r_dor
\     The ratio of the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit to the stellar radius for the recovered signal
\ Fit_Provenance
\     A flag indicating if the fit information comes from supplemental DV fits (1) or original DV fits (0)

As described in Sec 5 of https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KSCI-19110-001.pdf , many astronomers are using a model 

prob(Pipeline detects a planet as a TCE | Expected_MES ) = 0.94 * cdf(Gamma(30.87,0.271), Expected_MES )

Some astronomers are using a more sophisticated models (e.g., applying adjustments that students could read about in https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KSCI-19109-002.pdf), I think that this simple model is a good benchmark for students to beat.
